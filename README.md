[b]Notes:  
- The mod is to be taken semi-seriously. Some elements can come across as a bit meme-ish, and if they do, it's because it's intended that way. It can have a little satirical bite here and there, reminding us of [i]the world we live in todayâ„¢[/i].  
- If you find any problems, please do not hesitate to report them here in the comments or on [url=https://github.com/salva133/Vic3-Burgundism/issues/new]GitHub[/url] as an issue. I would very much like to deliver a stable functional mod for you and I can sometimes miss something in testing.  
- And I know how the Ordensstaat sought to achieve their goal, but here I do not want to see nukes. Instead I created a bit more of an eldritch path, a more occultistic flair.[/b]

[h1] Burgundism [/h1]
[h2] Overview [/h2]
The Burgundism Mod introduces the well-known ideological faction and corresponding governmental structures, laws, and some historical characters (WIP) into Victoria 3, inspired by the highly acclaimed HoI4 Mod "The New Order: Last days of Europe". This mod provides the Burgundist ideology, characterized by its unique blend of autocracy, occultism, and militarism.

[h2] Features [/h2]
[h3] Combat Unit Types [/h3]
- A new destructive kind of artillery, laying waste on anything. It does not discriminate, a true equaliser. End-Game-relevant.

[h3] Ideologies and Government Types [/h3]
- Burgundist Power Structure stances, Burgundist Economy stances and Burgundist Social Structure. Supports a strong state, an independent economy and a full extent in worker's rights. And by that I mean everyone has the right to be forced to work.
- Government Type "Burgundian System"

[h3] Religion [/h3]
- The Spartanists: a very sustainable and moderate view of faith.

[h3] Culture [/h3]
- The Burgundians: Followers of the spartanist ways from german heritage.

[h3] New Laws [/h3]
- Burgundism: The Burgundism is established as the official state religion, enforcing the principles of the Spartan faith upon all citizens.
- Spartanism: It is sweet and honourable to work for the fatherland. Who needs worker's rights anyway?
- Kleptocracy: If people don't want luxury, they don't need more money.
- Extensive Police Powers: A strong state needs a strong executive branch.
- Commitment to State Security: By ensuring a positive alignment of the people with the government we can provide stability.
- Duty for Self-Improvement: Everyone is encouraged to make the most of their body and to use all means and methods to do so.
- Total War Army Model: If it comes to the worst, everyone who can even hold a rifle must be... persuaded to do so.

[h3] New Institutions [/h3]
- Ministry of War: Dedicated to safeguarding the well-being of our nation and its citizens. Its primary mission is to maintain peace and stability, ensuring that external threats are neutralized before they can disrupt the order of our society. 
- Office for Labour Allocation: Supports the government with assigning the ever-growing amount of work force to get into labour.
- Ministry of Truth: Ensures the propagation of "true-flagged" information.
- Office for Self-Improvement: Encourages our citizen to work hard on themselves, ultimately overcoming themselves to get to true greatness.

[h3] (kinda) New Decrees [/h3]
- two rather known decrees, rebalanced (kudos to [url=https://steamcommunity.com/id/colonelnegative]colonelnegative[/url])
For use in lag reduction only ;)

[h3] A new Interest Group and Party [/h3]
- Burgundist Party: Available for multiple countries with flavored names.
- Burgundist Interest Group: Represents various social strata, including officers, soldiers, and middle-class professionals. It serves as the primary political vehicle for the Burgundist ideology and will become available as soon as the corresponding tech has been researched, a certain historical date has been reached (shortly after the historical end of the Great War), or you play a certain country (the name says it all here).

[h3] The new Country of Burgundy [/h3]
- Burgundy is now a release-able nation on the french soil with flags and flavored names for almost every government type. Simply select France, release Burgundy via the diplomacy screen and don't forget to tick "Play as". Burgundists with spartanist believes are the primary culture and a minority in that region, so you will have to handle cultures with care at first.

[h3] Economy Tweaks [/h3]
- raised the limit for the amount of slaves just to be able to get everyone into work. Remember: When you have work, your day has structure. To be precise, I have increased the maximum percentage of debt slaves in the population per state to 66% (vanilla is 15%).

[h3] New Technologies [/h3]
- introducing some tech, more to gatekeep the burgundian stuff not to get launched into the world too fast. The world may not be prepared for the glory of the black sun that early.

[h2] New Events & Journal Entries [/h2]
[h3] The Ticking [/h3]
- Once you reached totalism and your country has a say on the world stage (or you simply are Burgundy), you will be guided to the truest of lag reductions. Don't let the ticking drive you crazy. Or maybe.. maybe that is for the better. What do you think Alexey?  
..Alexey?

[h3] Occult Agitators [/h3]
- Dedicated events introducing characters of historical occult groups who seek to pursue their policies within nations that are technologically far enough, or they simply appear when their time has come.

[h2] Planned Features and Changes [/h2]
[h3] More Flavour [/h3]
- More flag and name variations depending on enacted laws
- a dedicated music mod maybe

[h3] Small Map reworks [/h3]
- still trying to find a method to dynamically rename cities based on the primary culture of the owner or simply the owning country.

[h2] Compatibility [/h2]
Can have issues with mods that adapt:
- economical mechanics
- pops
- techs
