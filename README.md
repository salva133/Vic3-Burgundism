[h1] Burgundism Mod for Victoria 3 [/h1]
[h2] Overview [/h2]

The Burgundism Mod introduces the well-known ideological faction and corresponding governmental structures, laws, and characters (WIP) into Victoria 3, inspired by the highly acclaimed HoI4 Mod "The New Order: Last days of Europe". This mod provides the Burgundist ideology, characterized by its unique blend of autocracy, technocracy, and militarism.

[h2] Features [/h2]
[h3] Ideologies and Government Types [/h3]
- Burgundist Power Structure stances, Burgundist Economy stances and Burgundist Social Structure. Supports a strong state, an independent economy and a full extent in worker's rights. And by that I mean everyone has the right to be forced to work.
- Government Type "Burgundian System"

[h3] Religion [/h3]
- The Spartanists: a very sustainable and moderate view of faith.

[h3] Culture [/h3]
- The Burgundians: Followers of the spartanist ways from german heritage.

[h3] Laws [/h3]
- Spartanism: It is sweet and honourable to work for the fatherland. Who needs worker's rights anyway?
- Kleptocracy: If people don't want luxury, they don't need more money.
- Total War Army Model: If it comes to the worst, everyone who can even hold a rifle must be... persuaded to do so.

- Burgundist Interest Group: Represents various social strata, including officers, soldiers, and middle-class professionals. It serves as the primary political vehicle for the Burgundist ideologyâ€‹ and will become available as soon as 

[h3] Country [/h3]
- Burgundy is now a release-able nation on the french soil with flags and flavored names for almost every government type. Simply select France, release Burgundy via the diplomacy screen and don't forget to tick "Play as". Burgundists are the primary culture and a minority in that region, so you will have to handle cultures with care at first.

[h3] Economy [/h3]
- raised the limit for the amount of slaves just to be able to get everyone into work. Remember: When you have work, your day has structure.

[h3] Technologies [/h3]
- introducing some tech, more to gatekeep the burgundian stuff not to get launched into the world too fast. The world may not be prepared for the glory of the black sun that early.
