  law_bgy_burgundism_desc: "Under the Burgundian system, the \"Burgundism\" is established as the official state religion, enforcing the principles of the Spartan faith upon all citizens. This belief system promotes absolute discipline, self-sacrifice, and collective strength above all else.\nCitizens are required to abandon personal desires and luxuries, dedicating their lives to the common good. Individuality is erased in favor of unwavering loyalty to the state. Every man and woman undergoes rigorous military training, for readiness for war is seen not only as a duty but a spiritual calling.\nAt the core of this faith is the worship of the Leader, whose authority is unquestionable, regarded as the divine embodiment of the state's will. Weakness, both physical and moral, is scorned, and those deemed unfit are excluded from society, ensuring only the strong contribute to the state's power.\nIn this harsh theocracy, the state demands absolute obedience. The collective thrives through the suppression of the self, shaping a society where citizens are molded into warriors, loyal only to the state and its supreme Leader."
