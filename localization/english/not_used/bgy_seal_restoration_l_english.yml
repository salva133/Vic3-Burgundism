And their white robes were taken from them; and it was said unto them, that they should rise now, for their fellowservants and their brethren, that should be spared as they were, have fulfilled their destiny."

  # the_ticking_events.13.f: "And I beheld when the first seal was restored, and, lo, the earth stood firm; and the sun shone bright as morning, and the moon glowed white as silver. And the stars of heaven rose back from the earth, even as a fig tree gathers her fruit, restored gently by a soft breeze. And the heaven returned as a scroll unrolled; and every mountain and island were restored to their rightful places. And the kings of the earth, and the great men, and the rich men, and the chief captains, and the mighty men, and every bondman, and every free man, emerged from the dens and the rocks of the mountains. And they spoke to the mountains and rocks, Rise up and reveal us to the face of him that sitteth on the throne, and from the grace of the Lamb. For the great day of his peace has come; and all shall be able to stand."
